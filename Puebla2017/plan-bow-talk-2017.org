*** Shapes of bow shocks
**** Parameters of a bow
+ Minimum useful set of parameters that characterise a bow shape
+ Defining R_0 and R_90 and R_c and \theta_\infty
  + Best use Fig 3 from quadrics paper
+ Interpretation
  + R_0 - characteristic size
  + R_c/R_0 - flatness of apex
  + R_90/R_0 - openness of near wings
  + \theta_\infty - openness of far wings

**** Projection on plane of sky
+ Use Fig 4 from quadrics paper
**** Empirical shape measurements
+ Use figure 1 from Luis Angel paper?
  + Would need modifying to include R90
+ Show Fig 1 from observational paper
  + Or two panels of it
*** The diagnostic diagram
+ Introduce via the MIPSGAL sources
+ Show Fig 2 of observational paper
*** The quadric shapes
+ What they are
  + Show Fig 6 of quadric paper
+ R_90 changes for same R_c with different T_c
  + Show Fig 7 from the paper
+ Quadrics and the diagnostic diagram
  + Show Fig 8 of quadric paper
  + Have an animated zoom in on the 0 \to 3 range of diagnostic graph
    + And have an animation of the dots moving with i 
+ Special case of the confocal paraboloid: does not move
*** A menagerie of theoretical bow shapes
+ The wilkinoid
+ The cantoid
+ The ancantoid
+ The dragoid
+ Regions of R_c-R_90 plane accessible to the models
*** Back to observations - MIPSGAL MIR sources
+ What are they?
  + Graph of non-shape parameters
  + Spectral type and distance variations
*** Null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST)
+ Figure showing distribution of p-values
+ All the statistical tests that we did
*** Comparison with cool stars
*** Comparison with Orion bows
*** Perturbed bows
- Bow shock stability
  + Dgani (1996)
- Time-varying wind
- Stationary waves
  - bow shapes
  - movement on R_c-R_90 two-ratio plane
*** Conclusions
- We have a new tool for analysing bow shapes
  - robust and simple to apply to observations
  - requires detection of inner stellar source (only)
- Application to different types of stellar bow shock
  - Hot stars
    - No clear difference in shape between supposed weather-vanes and runaways
      - \beta cannot be very large
      - or, the environmental identifications may be inaccurate
    - Median shape is approximately consistent with Wilkinoid
      - Numerical simulations also bear this out
    - But much larger variety of shape, especially in R_c
      - Perhaps evidence for standing wave perturbations
        - instabilities or time-varying wind
      - But fact that \sigma(R_90/R_0) increases with R_0 is hard to understand
        - especially since observational uncertainties decrease with R_0
  - Cool stars (all runaways): more closed shapes
    - Broadly consistent with dragoids
    - But I think ellipsoidal shells are more likely (numerical simulations)
  - Orion bows: much flatter and more open
*** New names?
+ R_c / R_0 - planitude
+ R_90 / R_0 - alatude
+ So we have the planitude–alatude diagram
