** DONE [3/3] Shapes of bow shocks
CLOSED: [2017-10-19 Thu 18:07]
*** DONE Parameters of a bow
CLOSED: [2017-10-19 Thu 16:46]
+ Minimum useful set of parameters that characterise a bow shape
+ Defining R_0 and R_90 and R_c and \theta_\infty
  + Best use Fig 3 from quadrics paper
+ Interpretation
  + R_0 - characteristic size
  + R_c/R_0 - flatness of apex
  + R_90/R_0 - openness of near wings
  + \theta_\infty - openness of far wings

*** DONE Projection on plane of sky
CLOSED: [2017-10-19 Thu 17:38]
+ Use Fig 4 from quadrics paper
*** DONE Empirical shape measurements
CLOSED: [2017-10-19 Thu 18:07]
+ Use figure 1 from Luis Angel paper?
  + Would need modifying to include R90
+ Show Fig 1 from observational paper
  + Or two panels of it
** DONE The diagnostic diagram
CLOSED: [2017-10-19 Thu 19:44]
+ Introduce via the MIPSGAL sources
+ Show Fig 2 of observational paper
** DONE An historical antecedent
CLOSED: [2017-10-20 Fri 18:53]
+ The R_0/D--R_90/D diagram from Robberto et al. (2005)
+ Two problems
  1. Strong correlation between x and y => everything is compressed on the diagonal
  2. We usually do not have a measurement for D
** DONE The quadric shapes
CLOSED: [2017-10-20 Fri 11:27]
+ What they are
  + Show Fig 6 of quadric paper
+ R_90 changes for same R_c with different T_c
  + Show Fig 7 from the paper
+ Quadrics and the diagnostic diagram
  + Show Fig 8 of quadric paper
  + Have an animated zoom in on the 0 \to 3 range of diagnostic graph
    + And have an animation of the dots moving with i 
+ Special case of the confocal paraboloid: does not move
** DONE A menagerie of theoretical bow shapes
CLOSED: [2017-10-20 Fri 20:46]
+ The wilkinoid
+ The cantoid
+ The ancantoid
+ The dragoid
+ Regions of R_c-R_90 plane accessible to the models
** TODO Back to observations - MIPSGAL MIR sources
+ What are they?
  + Graph of non-shape parameters
  + Spectral type and distance variations
** TODO Null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST)
+ Figure showing distribution of p-values
+ All the statistical tests that we did

  + Dgani (1996)
- Time-varying wind
- Stationary waves
  - bow shapes
  - movement on R_c-R_90 two-ratio plane
** DONE Conclusions
CLOSED: [2017-10-19 Thu 18:08]
- We have a new tool for analysing bow shapes
  - robust and simple to apply to observations
  - requires detection of inner stellar source (only)
- Sample application to different types of stellar bow shock
  - Hot stars
    - No clear difference in shape between supposed weather-vanes and runaways
      - \beta cannot be very large
      - or, the environmental identifications may be inaccurate
    - Median shape is approximately consistent with Wilkinoid
      - Numerical simulations also bear this out
    - But much larger variety of shape, especially in R_c
      - Shape is surprisingly uncorrelated with any other parameter
      - Perhaps evidence for standing wave perturbations
        - instabilities or time-varying wind
      - But fact that \sigma(\Lambda) increases with R_0 is hard to understand
        - Maybe perturbation amplitudes larger for brighter stars
        - especially since observational uncertainties decrease with R_0
  - Cool stars (all runaways): more closed shapes
    - Broadly consistent with dragoids
    - But I think ellipsoidal shells are more likely (numerical simulations)
  - Orion bows: much flatter and more open
    - Median shapes consistent with cantoids with \beta \sim 0.05
    - But other considerations suggest that finite Mach number effects are more important
** New names?
+ R_c / R_0 - planitude
+ R_90 / R_0 - alatude
+ So we have the planitude–alatude diagram
+ Do we want symbols for them?
  + Robus and \Lambda perhaps?
  + Or stick with \(\widetilde{R_c}\) and \(\widetilde{R_{90}}\) ?
+ Advantage of \(\Pi\) and \(\Lambda\) is that they well represent the quantities:
  + \(\Pi\) has the flat top
  + \(\Lambda\) has the opening wings
+ But I will need to re-do all the figures!
