** Title 
Runaways and weather vanes: the shapes of stellar bow shocks
*** Intro
+ Bow waves and bow shocks
  + Supersonic bullets - images
  + Dolphin on bow wave of ship
    + https://www.flickr.com/photos/oneeighteen/3477163368
  + Dolphin on bow wave of nuclear sub
    + Good video https://youtu.be/Kc8XojxN-Xg
    + Nice image but a bit small http://justjoep.blogspot.mx/2012/03/nuclear-dolphin-bow-wave.html
+ Astrophysical bow shocks
  + Jet working surfaces
    + No star to use as reference
  + Binary stars
    + Too small to see
  + Stellar bow shocks
    + ACS images of runaways
      + Sahai 
      + http://hubblesite.org/news_release/news/2009-03
      + No paper that I can find - some might be EGGS/proplyds
    + AGB stars
      + Betelgeuse
        + Decin (2012)
      + Survey
        + Cox (2012)
        + Also Cox (2015) proceedings
      + GALEX UV observations
        + Sahai (2010)
        + Saha (2014) - CIT 6
      + H I observations
        + Le Betre (2012) - Betelgeuse, not impressive!
        + Matthews (2013) - other AGB, again very messy
    + OB stars
    + Proplyd bow shocks
    + LL objects
    + Galactic center stars
      + Zajaček (2016)
  + Dust waves
    + Oschendorf
      + Criticised in Mackey (2016)
    + Akimkin (2015) considers dust drag in detail
    + See also Katushkina (2017)
      + Lorentz force gives filament structures
  + Numerical Models
    + Villaver (2012)
      + AGB stars - 2D - nice images
    + Mohamed (2012)
      + Betelgeuse - 3D - videos and images
    + Van Marle (2011)
      + Dust dynamics
    + Meyer (2014)
      + Massive runaway
    + Meyer (2016)
      + more runaway
+ Things that are not bow shocks, but which might get confused with them
  + Proplyds
  + EGGS
  + Cometary knots
*** Shapes of bow shocks
+ Defining R0 and R90 and Rc
  + Use figure from Luis Angel paper
*** Bow shock stability
+ Dgani (1996)
