** DONE Conclusions
CLOSED: [2017-10-19 Thu 18:08]
- We have a new tool for analysing bow shapes
  - robust and simple to apply to observations
  - requires detection of inner stellar source (only)
- Sample application to different types of stellar bow shock
  - Hot stars
    - No clear difference in shape between supposed weather-vanes and runaways
      - \beta cannot be very large
      - or, the environmental identifications may be inaccurate
    - Median shape is approximately consistent with Wilkinoid
      - Numerical simulations also bear this out
    - But much larger variety of shape, especially in R_c
      - Shape is surprisingly uncorrelated with any other parameter
      - Perhaps evidence for standing wave perturbations
        - instabilities or time-varying wind
      - But fact that \sigma(\Lambda) increases with R_0 is hard to understand
        - Maybe perturbation amplitudes larger for brighter stars
        - especially since observational uncertainties decrease with R_0
  - Cool stars (all runaways): more closed shapes
    - Broadly consistent with dragoids
    - But I think ellipsoidal shells are more likely (numerical simulations)
  - Orion bows: much flatter and more open
    - Median shapes consistent with cantoids with \beta \sim 0.05
    - But other considerations suggest that finite Mach number effects are more important
** New names?
+ R_c / R_0 - planitude
+ R_90 / R_0 - alatude
+ So we have the planitude–alatude diagram
+ Do we want symbols for them?
  + Robus and \Lambda perhaps?
  + Or stick with \(\widetilde{R_c}\) and \(\widetilde{R_{90}}\) ?
+ Advantage of \(\Pi\) and \(\Lambda\) is that they well represent the quantities:
  + \(\Pi\) has the flat top
  + \(\Lambda\) has the opening wings
+ But I will need to re-do all the figures!

*** Abstract
:LOGBOOK:
- Note taken on [2017-12-07 Thu 09:02] \\
  For some reason I can't find the one that I originally sent.  I will cobble together a new one
:END:
Stellar bow shocks are the result of the supersonic interaction
between a stellar wind and its environment. Some of these are
"runaways": high-velocity stars that have been ejected from a star
cluster. Others are "weather vanes", where it is the local
interstellar medium itself that is moving, perhaps as the result of a
champagne flow of ionized gas from a nearby HII region.  We propose a
new two-dimensional classification scheme for bow shapes, which is
based on dimensionless geometric ratios that can be estimated from
observational images. The two ratios are related to the flatness of
the bow’s apex, which we term planitude and the openness of its wings,
which we term alatude.  We calculate the inclination-dependent tracks
on the planitude-alatude plane that are predicted by simple models for
the bow shock shape.  We also measure the shapes of bow shocks from
three different observational datasets: mid-infrared arcs around hot
main-sequence stars, far-infrared arcs around luminous cool stars, and
emission-line arcs around proplyds and other young stars in the Orion
Nebula.  Clear differences are found between the different datasets in
their distributions on the planitude-alatude plane, which can be used
to constrain the physics of the bow shock interaction and emission
mechanisms in the different classes of object.
