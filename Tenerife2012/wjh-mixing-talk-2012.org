* Abundance fluctuations in HII regions and PNe

** Observational support
    :PROPERTIES:
    :END:
+ PNe - ADF - (Liu 2002 and talk by Xuan Fang on Tuesday)
  + Indications that \(T(\mathrm{ORL}) < T(\mathrm{Bac}) < T(\mathrm{He}) < T(\mathrm{CEL})\)
    + @The kappa-distribution cannot explain this!@
      + (unless we have \(\kappa^2\) fluctuations!!!)
  + natural explanation is cool, high-metallicity clumps
+ HII - yet another explanation for the t2/ADF phenomenon

** How can metal-rich fluctuations be preserved?

+ Mixing is the enemy
  + molecular diffusion
  + turbulence
+ Turbulence stirs up the gas
  + reducing the spatial scale of the inhomogeneities
  + then molecular diffusion can act to achieve true microscopic mixing


** Advection, diffusion, sources and sinks

** Mixing within ionized nebulae

This is main focus because this is what I have worked on.  

*** Can chemical inhomogeneities be sustained?

+ What causes the imhomogeneities in the first place?

+ How quickly are they wiped out?


**** HII regions

+ Cloudlets from galactic fountain with spray (but see Spitoni)
  + Mixing within superbubbles gives locally homogeneous but enhanced metallicity
    + details?

**** Planetary nebulae


** Galactic large-scale mixing

*** Spitoni et al 2009
+ http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A%26A...504...87S
+ Effects of galactic fountains and delayed mixing in the chemical evolution of the Milky Way
+ They claim that realistic "Galactic Fountain mixing delays" (0.1 Gyr) have no effect on chemical evolution models for the Galaxy
  + Supposedly, galactic fountains can't throw stuff much further than 1kpc away from its point of origin
  + But the material stays up in the halo orbiting around for a while before falling back down
+ There is also the "metal cooling delay"
  + Stars only form in cold gas, but it takes the hot gas a long time to cool
  + This is basically the Tenorio-Tagle idea 
+ More massive present-day galaxies formed earlier in the evolution of the universe


** Nova shells

Here, mixing plays a rather different role - it actually produces the inhomogeneities, rather than destroying them.  Through KH, buoyant plumes, breaking waves, etc.

But this requires a pre-existing inhomogeneity in abundances, caused by gravity (all the CO material locked in the stellar core). 

*** Casanova et al 2011
+ http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011Natur.478..490C
+ Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities as the source of inhomogeneous mixing in nova explosions
+ Nova shells at early stages always show both enriched and inhomogensous abundances
  + e.g., threefold differences in C/He ratio between knots
+ Nova outbursts triggered by CNO reactions that make super-solar 13N 14O, 15O, 17F
+ Convection drives some of these into the envelope and their decay helps drive the expansion
+ So, the clue is in the title:
  + KH instabilities mean that the mixing of enriched material from the core to the envelope is inhomogeneous
  + They say that this can explain the observed dispersion in abundances seen between individual ejecta knots.  And can explain the origin of the knots themselves.
