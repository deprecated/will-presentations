Only short, so don't need much stuff.

* General outline

** Brief overview of scope and ingredients
** Turbulent HII regions
*** Show video
*** Turbulence statistics
*** Observational diagnostics
** Missing ingredients
*** Magnetic fields
*** Stellar winds



* Stuff on stellar winds
+ More important for more massive clusters
+ Very dependent on whether energy or momentum driven
+ Show videos of two cases
+ Also show cuts through the cubes
+ Uncertainties in the physics of stellar wind shocks
  + Why is gas always at 1e6 K?
  + Jane's paper on Orion
  + Models produce hard x-rays that are not observed

#+TBLFM: $8=$-1/$-2;f2

+ The first three come from Anorve-Zeferino
+ M17 comes from various places, including Povich et al (2009)
+ M42 comes from Guedel (2008) and elsewhere
+ Note that 1 keV = 1.16e7 K
*** TODO Resolve discrepancy in T for same source
Particularly NGC 3603 - see Townsley paper below

* X-rays from wind-bubbles in massive star clusters

** Townsley et al 2011b: Chandra observations of many regions
+ Three temperature fits to spectra
+ Gives NGC 3603 components as 0.53, 0.35, 0.6 keV
  + Wiht the 0.6 keV component dominating
  + [ ] This is much softer than the 3.1 keV given in Anorve-Zeferino - why?
** Ezoe et al 2008: Carina XMM observations
+ Two temperature fits to spectra
+ 0.25 and 0.55 keV with roughly equal fluxes
** Guedel 2008: Orion Wind Bubble XMM observations
+ 1 - 2 e6 K single-temperature fits
** Arthur 2013: Orion Wind bubble theory
+ (notes taken with text to speech via touchpad my iphone)
+ spherical models of wind bubble in Orion
  + models with mass loading
  + models with conduction
  + models with both
+ Luminosity is okay
+ Spectrum is too hard
  +  soft is less than 1 kilo electron volts
** Vel√°zquez et al 2013: M17 wind bubble theory
+ Soft x-rays (0.5-1.5 keV) come from wind-ism interaction
  + extends to low-density part of the bubble
+ Harder x-rays come from the wind-wind interaction zone
  + concetrated around the core of the cluster
** Mernier 2013: M17 X-rays observations
+ Diffuse emission covered in
  + Fig 1
  + Sec 3.3
  + Fig 8 - spectrum is clearly harder than what is seen in Orion
** Anorve-Zeferino 2008: X-rays from SSCs
+ Mainly consider: NGC 3606, Arches, Quintuplet
+ 
+ Also consider M17 case
+ Have varying degrees of inhibition of conduction
+ 

** Povich et al. 2008: weather vanes
+ They find MIR bowshocks in M17 and RCW 49
+ They interpret these as O stars in the periphery of the HII region
+ Most are interacting with the HII region gas
+ But one may be interacting with the stellar wind exhaust
