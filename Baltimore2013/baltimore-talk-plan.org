* Title of talk
Dynamics of the Orion Nebula: ISM
* What to include
** Mainly based on Poland Talk
New bits are marked with checkboxes.
+ Physical ingredients
  + Governing equations
  + Ionization balance
  + Radiative transfer
  + Body forces
  + Magnetic fields
+ Building blocks for the internal dynamics
  + Thermal pressure gradients
  + Steady state photoevaporation flows
  + Winds, shocks
    + [ ] Add in some LL object stuff here
    + More stuff on stellar wind?
+ Application of HII region models to Orion
  + Simple models
  + Turbulent models
+ [ ] Observational diagnostics of the dynamics
  1. Spectroscopy: line-of-sight movement
  2. Proper motions: plane-of-sky movement
     + But only pattern speeds - non-steady motions
  3. Test particles
