* Poster for Townsville meeting - September 2010

Plan is to use tikz mindmap library to make something amazing!

** Figures
*** Bstar evolution
**** Mosaic of BBB and xTd images
+ [X] [[file:figs/src/mhdcuts-Bstar-mosaic.py][mhdcuts-Bstar-mosaic.py]]
  + [[file:figs/src/mhdcuts-Bstar-mosaic-bright.png][mhdcuts-Bstar-mosaic-bright.png]]
**** Mosaic of emission images
+ [X] [[file:figs/src/rgb-im-Bstar-mosaic.py][rgb-im-Bstar-mosaic.py]]
  + [[file:figs/src/rgb-im-Bstar-mosaic-bright.png][rgb-im-Bstar-mosaic-bright.png]]

** Outline of poster
This should map to a tree structure in tikz
+ Subheadings represent child nodes
+ Plain lists represent contents of the node

*** Title Node
+ Title 
+ Abstract
  + this can actually be the conclusions

**** Authors
+ List of authors
  + superscripted with affiliation
**** CRyA
+ CRyA Photo
***** Will Henney

*** Results - cut planes

*** Results - simulated images
**** MHD versus HD
***** Optical lines
***** Long wavelength
**** B star versus O star
***** Optical lines
***** Long wavelength


*** Results - statistics

**** Pressures

**** Thermal

*** Detailed view of individual globules

*** Conclusions


* Use of Tikz

+ The manual is here: [[file:/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/doc/generic/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf][pgfmanual.pdf]]


** Putting stuff on the background layer
Example from manual:
#+begin_src latex
  \begin{pgfonlayer}{background} 
  \node [fill=black!30,fit=(waiting) (critical) (semaphore) (leave critical) (enter critical)] {}; 
  \end{pgfonlayer} 
#+end_src
That requires the =fit= library. In our case, we just need to fill the page.

** Size of concept nodes

+ They can be changed with =text width=, but we also need to set =level distance= on each child, otherwise they overlap

+ This seems to work doing things by hand, but I really want to define a new style (like =huge mindmap=) that will set all these parameters at once. 

** Size of paper

+ Paper width is 36in = 91.44cm
