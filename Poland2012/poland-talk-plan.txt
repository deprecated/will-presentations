* Motivation

- Dynamics of Orion
  - Global evolution
    - Structure of environment
    - Evolutionary timescale
  - Internal structure
    - Kinematics of ionized gas

* Physical Ingredients
  - Governing equations 
    - Euler equations (mass, momentum, energy)
      - mass (or continuity) equation allows one to relate the density to the velocity for a given geometry (divergent, convergent, plane parallel)
      - energy equation is important for determining the local sound speed but this is roughly constant in the ionized gas 
    - ionization balance
      - most concisely expressed by an ionization parameter, can be local or global
        - global ionization parameter Upsilon ~ (Q_H n)^{1/3}
          - apart from the degree of ionization, the ionization parameter also determines other things
          - how important is dust opacity? For a given dust/gas ratio, it is more important for high Upsilon
            - the dust optical depth to the ionization front is proportional to Upsilon
          - How important is advection in the global ionization balance? More important for low Upsilon
    - radiative transfer
      - ionizing radiation
        - all absorbed in the H II region
          - the same mass of gas is more efficient at absorbing ionizing radiation when the density is increased (and vice versa)
          - this means that compressed shells can trap the i-front
          - also explains why more gas is ionized as the region expands
          - the emissivity of a recombination line such as H alpha effectively traces the local absorption of ionizing radiation (assuming static ionization equilibrium)
          - the surface brightness of an ionization bounded layer therefore traces the flux of ionizing radiation that is incident upon it (modulo geometrical factors...)
        - diffuse ionizing field from recombinations and scattering
      - FUV/optical radiation
        - some absorbed in the H II region but mainly in the near PDR
      - X rays
        - produced by 
          - 50% T Tauri chromospheres
          - 50% O star wind acceleration zone
          - 1% Stellar wind bubble
        - absorbed in far PDR and molecular gas
        
  - Momentum equation is the one most directly related to the dynamics
     - and mass equation and energy equation
     - three parts: non-steady, dynamic pressure balance, and body forces
  - Thermal pressure gradients
     - non steady global evolution
        - Spitzer solution for uniform medium
        - Modification in turbulent case
  - Ionization balance and radiative transfer
     - indirect effect on dynamics (via energy equation)
     - structure of an ionization front
  - Body forces
    - Gravity
      - Only important for the molecular gas
    - Radiation pressure
      - trapped resonance lines
      - ionizing radiation momentum acting on gas
      - Lower energy radiation acting on dust
    - Magnetic field

* Building blocks for the internal dynamics
  - Ionization fronts
  - Photoevaporation flows
    - steady state photo evaporation flows
        - carving out cavity
        - application to Orion
          - Bar / proplyds / Orion S
     - champagne flow 
       - transient spherical ones
       - steady one-sided ones
  - Stellar winds
  - Shocks
    - non-steady shocks
      - global shock driven into ISM by H II region expansion
      - bow shocks driven by stellar jets (HH objects)
    - steady state shocks
      - proplyds bow shocks
      - LL object bow shocks
      - stellar wind stagnation shock
        - there will only be a distinct shell in the ionized gas if there are supersonic internal flows.
